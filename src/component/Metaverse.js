    As an organization, we are committed to upholding the history and traditions 
    of our country. In that context, we aim to deliver an immersive 
    experience through Metaverse virtual reality wherein people from 
    all corners of the world will have the capability to experience Vedic 
    Bharat in its truest sense. Moreover, they will be able to interact on 
    multiple levels with each other in the exact cultural and geographical 
    setup of an Indian traditional destination, albeit virtually. In this context, 
    understanding the metaverse will be important.</p>
    <p style={{marginTop: '0px',textAlign:'justify'}}>While our metaverse virtual 
    reality will enable people to gain rich travel experiences in an immersive environment, 
    we do have other applications as well. We believe, the FuFi metaverse will be extremely 
    relevant in the highly crippled real-estate industry. Most importantly, customers 
    will have the option to take virtual tours of properties irrespective of which corner 
    of the world those are located in. Another potent application of our metaverse would be 
    the education industry and corporate sector. As we continue to battle with the pandemic, 
    we believe, the best-case scenario in the far-fetched future would be the hybrid model of 
    working or learning. The Fufi Metaverse stock will have other relevant use cases as well.
